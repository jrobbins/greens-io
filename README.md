# greens-io
A collaborative idle game about software testing


# Goals
* Build a starkly abstract, fun colaborative idle game
* Learn how to code and host an idle game

# What is an idle game?
* First off, it is not an arcade game.  It is more akin to a text adventure but without the text.
* Players click buttons that have overblown labels to increment an odometer to outlandish values.
* Extreme emphasis on gameplay mecahnics rather than graphics, sound, or story

# What is greens-io?
* It is a very abstract devops simulation that counts the number of passing test runs.
* Multiple players, who can join a server at any time.
* Sometimes colaboration is required.  E.g., one-click code reviews.


# Greens-io rules
* The goal is to reach the highest possible number of greens.
* Each game lasts exactly one year of game time, which is about 30 minutes of real time.
* Players start by clicking a "Do manual test" button that causes one test run.
* Players press other buttons to build a manual or automated test suite.
* Each test run generates some greens, which are a spendable resource.
* Players can spend greens and other resources unlock new game mechanics, e.g., automated test suites, CI, etc.
* Players discover that mechanics exist in a complex tree of prequisites and costs, and have whimsical labels.
* As real time advances, an in-game calendar advances until the end of one year.
* At the end of the game, each player is shown a summary of achievements.



# UI and controls
* Use keyboard or mouse to click buttons.   There might be some other widgets too.
* A log of daily activity is shown on the right.
* When some resource needs attention, it will sometimes display in red.


# Strategy
* Don't settle for incremental or linear progress.
* Always be looking for opportunities to make geometric or expoential progress.
* Watch out for bottlenecks and switch your focus to resolving them.
* Be responsive to teammates when their actions are blocked on your response.
* Specialize and coordinate.  Communicate via a video conference or chat outside the game.


# Joining and respawning
* Each player choose a nick
